## Application Setup

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/jeremyjosol/project_name.git) by either copying the link or entering the command in your terminal:
`git clone enter_link_here`
2. Navigate to the **'projectname_project'** directory that you've just cloned:
`cd projectname_project`
3. Before you can use or deploy the project, make sure to install its dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:
`npm install`
This command will read the **package.json** file and install all the required packages.

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you're ready to either build or deploy the project. You can also run the local development server. Here are a couple of options:
* To build the project:
`npm run build`
This will prepare the project for deployment.
* To start the local development server:
`npm run start`
5. To run tests using **Jest**, enter the command:
`npm run test`
6. Additionally, you can lint files to ensure code quality executing the command:
`npm run lint`
7. Alternatively, if you'd like to view the project without setting up a local environment, you can access it on GitHub Pages.

You should now be set up to use, develop, and test **Project Name**. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out or refer to the project's documentation.
